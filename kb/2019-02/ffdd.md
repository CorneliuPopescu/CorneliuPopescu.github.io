# Fitness function-driven development

> How do we enable evolution? Architectural goals and constraints may all change independently of functional expectations.

During test-driven development we write tests to verify that features conform to desired business outcomes; with fitness function-driven development we can also write tests that measure a systemâ€™s alignment to architectural goals.
