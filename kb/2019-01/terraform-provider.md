> Terrafom is an amazing tool that lets you define your infrastructure as code. Under the hood it's an incredibly powerful state machine that makes API requests and marshals resources.

> In this talk, Eddie Zaneski, manager of developer relations at DigitalOcean, will dive into the inner workings of Terraform and examine all the elements of a providerâ€”from the documentation to the test suite. You'll walk away with the knowledge of how to contribute to an existing provider or create your own from scratch.
