# Kong 1.0 GA

> Today, we’re thrilled to announce the general availability of Kong 1.0 – a scalable, fast, open source Microservice API Gateway built to manage, secure and connect hybrid and cloud-native architectures. Kong runs in front of any service and is extended through plugins including authentication, traffic control, observability and more. 
>
> In 1.0, users can now deploy Kong not only as an API gateway but also as a standalone service-mesh proxy. Kong plugins provide key functionality for service mesh out of the box and integrations with other cloud-native technologies including Prometheus, Zipkin, health checks, canary, blue-green and much more.
