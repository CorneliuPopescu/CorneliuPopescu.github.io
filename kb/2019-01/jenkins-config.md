# Jenkins Configuration as Code

> The ‘as code’ paradigm is about being able to reproduce and/or restore a full environment within minutes based on recipes and automation, managed as code.
>
> Setting up Jenkins is a complex process, as both Jenkins and its plugins require some tuning and configuration, with dozens of parameters to set within the web UI manage section.
>
> Jenkins Configuration as Code allows to define this whole configuration as a simple, human-friendly, plain text yaml syntax. Without any manual step this configuration can be validated and applied to a Jenkins master in fully a reproducible way. With JCasC setting up a new Jenkins master will become a no-brainer event.
