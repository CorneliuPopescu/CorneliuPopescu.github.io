# Getting Started with Istio Service Mesh Routing

> In the following tutorial, we will use Istio to demonstrate one of the most powerful features of service meshes: “per request routing.” This feature allows the routing of arbitrary requests that are marked by selected HTTP headers to specific targets, which is possible only with a (OSI) layer 7 proxy. No layer 4 load balancer or proxy can achieve this functionality.
>
> Istio is a service mesh. It is composed of control plane and data plane. For the data plane it uses Envoy proxy. Envoy itself is a L7 proxy and communication bus designed for modern microservices based architecture.
