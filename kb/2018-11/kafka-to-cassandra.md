# Kafka Cassandra Sink

> The Connect API Sources and Sinks act as sensors on the edge of our analytics platform, loading and unloading events as they happen real time. Under the hood they are Kafka consumers and producers with a simple and elegant API that allows developers to focus on moving data to and from Kafka.
>
> The DataStax Certified Connector, developed by DataMountaineer, simplifies writing data from Kafka into Cassandra. The connector converts the value from the Kafka Connect SinkRecords to Json. A fail fast thread pool is then used to insert the records asynchronously into Cassandra.
