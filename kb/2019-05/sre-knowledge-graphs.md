# SRE: Knowledge Graphs: Increased Context in Human Involved Incident Response(IR)

> Incident response involving human responders requires context of systems and services that are encountering issues. Getting this context is increasingly hard as the size of an organization grows and the number of services grow. 
>
> This post proposes a simple, low friction approach to centralizing critical events related to services (such as deploys) which reduces burden on IR engineer, reduces MTTR and makes querying complex system data and event state trivial.
