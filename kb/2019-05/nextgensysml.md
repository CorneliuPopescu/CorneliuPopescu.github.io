# Next Generation System Modeling Language - NextGenSysML

> It is time for the next generation of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). More than 10 years ago the Object Management Group (OMG) published SysML version 1.0 to provide a simple but powerful modeling language for a wide range of systems engineering problems.
>
> In June 2018 the OMG published another RFP â€“ the SysML API & Services RFP. That RFP defines the requirements for a standardized interface to access SysML models independent of the modeling tool. That is a groundbreaking standard supplementing SysML v2.
>
> This blog post series gives an overview of the SysML v2 and the SysML API & Services RFPs.
