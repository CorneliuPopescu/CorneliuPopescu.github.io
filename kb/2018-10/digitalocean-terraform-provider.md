# Introducing the DigitalOcean Terraform Provider

> Terraform provides you with a safe and predictable way to create, change, and version your infrastructure. It has become an essential part of many DigitalOcean users' workflow, and we want to ensure it receives the support it deserves. That's why we were so excited to release version 1.0.0 of the DigitalOcean Terraform Provider. This release marks a major milestone: the first since DigitalOcean took ownership of the project and a declaration of our commitment to support its continued development.
