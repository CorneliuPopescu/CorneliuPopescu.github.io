# A New Neo4j Integration with Apache Kafka

> In the past year we have received a lot of requests for an integration of Neo4j with Apache Kafka and other streaming data solutions. So a few weeks ago, with the help of our Italian partner LARUS (esp. Andrea Santurbano) and our colleague Stefan Armbruster, we started to work on a first integration.
>
> Today we want to make this available in a first release under an Apache License for you to try out and test. It works with Neo4j from 3.4.x and Kafka from 0.10.x.
