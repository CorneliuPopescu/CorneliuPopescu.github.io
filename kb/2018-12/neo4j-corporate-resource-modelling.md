# Neo4j Online Meetup #43: Iterative modeling of corporate resources in a rapidly growing company

> A decade of growth as a software as service company has led to continual change and some dramatic reorganizations. We observe our own evolution by collecting metadata from all aspects of our operations to build a graph based structure warehouse called El Dorado. We maintain over a hundred standard queries which we render as hyperlinked tables and diagrams. Ad-hoc variations are easily shared over corporate chat and when proven useful become part of our standard repertoire. This integrated view allows us to measure the penetration of new services and methods as well as track down lingering legacy resources. Weâ€™ve made some of our custom graph infrastructure open source as we think our approach to provenance could be generally useful.
