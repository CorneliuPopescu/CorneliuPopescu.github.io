[PDF](../../docs/jHipster-5.pdf){:target="_blank"}

> The JHipster Mini-Book is a guide to getting started with hip technologies today: Angular, Bootstrap and Spring Boot. All of these frameworks are wrapped up in an easy-to-use project called JHipster. JHipster is a development platform to generate, develop and deploy Spring Boot + Angular (or React) web applications and microservices. This book shows you how to build an app with JHipster, and guides you through the plethora of tools, techniques, and options you can use. Furthermore, it explains the UI and API building blocks so you understand the underpinnings of your great application. It also shows you how to use Docker Compose and deploy your microservices to Heroku.

> The latest edition (v5.0) is updated for JHipster 5. This edition includes new sections on progressive web apps (PWA), code quality, and securing user data.
