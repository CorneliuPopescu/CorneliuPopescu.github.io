# The End of Industrial Automation (As We Know It)

> A major technology disruption is approaching in the world of industrial automation.  This disruption has the potential to render long-held supplier business models obsolete.  It will also require suppliers of all types to adopt emerging software technologies and practices from the cloud computing domain.  This disruption will be driven almost entirely by new software technology rather than hardware.  While the disruption will first impact continuous process automation, the power and value of these new software technologies will drive them and their new business models into many other areas, including much of factory automation and into the Industrial IoT.
