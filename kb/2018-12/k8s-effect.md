# The Kubernetes Effect

> The way we should look at Kubernetes is more like a fundamental paradigm that has implications in multiple dimensions, rather than an API to interact with.
>
> Kubernetes adds a completely new dimension to language-based building blocks by offering a new set of distributed primitives and runtime for creating distributed systems that spread across multiple processes and nodes.
>
> Container design patterns are focused on structuring the containers and other distributed primitives in the best possible way for solving the challenges at hand. Patterns include sidecar, ambassador, adapter, initializer, work queue, custom controller, and self awareness.
