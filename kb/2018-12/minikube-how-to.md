# How to Use Minikube to Create Kubernetes Clusters and Deploy Applications

> We are going to create new Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, a lightweight Kubernetes implementation that creates a VM on your local machine and deploys a simple cluster containing only one node.
>
> The Minikube CLI provides basic bootstrapping operations for working with your cluster, including start, stop, status and delete. We are going to use kubectl utility to deploy and manage applications on Kubernetes. Also, you can inspect cluster resources; create, delete and update components and look at new clusters.
