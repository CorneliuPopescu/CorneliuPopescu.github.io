# Airtable

> In a world filled with increasingly specific and rigid apps, Airtable takes a radically different approach by giving you (yes, you!) the building blocks to create your own way of organizing anything from film projects to apartment hunts and customer lists.
>
> It makes all of this possible by giving you the ability to create your own databases and adapting them to your specific needs. Planning a wedding? You can set up Airtable to keep track of guests, venues, and gifts in exactly the way that you want. Use it to manage projects, organize customer relationships, catalog your inventory, or make reusable checklists. All this with a fast, flexible, spreadsheet-like interface that you already know how to use.
