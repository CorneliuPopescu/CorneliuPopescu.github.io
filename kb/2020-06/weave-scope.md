# Weave Scope

> Automate and manage canary and other advanced deployments with Istio, Linkerd, AWS App Mesh or NGINX for traffic shifting. Integrated Prometheus metrics control canary deployment success or failure.
>
> Flagger implements a control loop that gradually shifts traffic to the canary while measuring key performance indicators like HTTP requests success rate, requests average duration and pods health. Based on the set thresholds, a canary is either promoted or aborted and its analysis is pushed to a Slack channel.
